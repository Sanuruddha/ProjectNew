<div id="Desc"><h3>Description</h3>

<p>Diabetes, often referred to by doctors as <strong>diabetes mellitus</strong> is a chronic condition associated with abnormally high levels of sugar (Glucose) in the blood. This is caused either because insufficient production of insulin by the pancreas or because the inability of the body's cells to respond properly to insulin, or both.</p>

<p><strong>There are three types of Diabetes.</strong></p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gestational diabetes</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2><span><strong>Type 1 Diabetes</strong></span></h2>

<p>Type 1 diabetes, once known as <strong>Juvenile Diabetes</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Insulin Dependent diabetes or early-onset diabetes</strong>. With type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks part of its own pancreas. (Scientists are not sure why) but the immune system mistakenly sees the insulin producing cells in the pancreas as foreign, and destroys them. This attack is known as "Autoimmune" disease.</p>

<p>People usually develop type 1 diabetes before their 40th year, often in early adulthood or teenage years. People with type 1 diabetes will need to take insulin injections for the rest of their life. They must also ensure proper blood-glucose levels by carrying out regular blood tests and following a special diet.</p>

<h2><span><strong>Type 2 Diabetes</strong></span></h2>

<p>Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. If you have type 2 diabetes your body does not use insulin properly.</p>
<p>Approximately 90% of all the cases of diabetes worldwide are type 2.</p>

<h4>RISK FACTORS FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES</h4>

<ul>
<li>Being overweight or obese</li>
<li>Leading a sedentary lifestyle</li>
<li>Family history of diabetes</li>
<li>Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)</li>
<li>Low levels of the "good" cholesterol (HDL)</li>
<li>Elevated levels of triglycerides in the blood</li>
</ul>

<p>The risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also greater as we get older. This is because as we age we tend to put on weight and become less physically active. People of Middle Eastern, African, or South Asian descent also have a high risk. Men whose testosterone levels are low have been found to have a high risk.</p>

<h2><span><strong>Gestational Diabetes</strong></span></h2>

<p>&nbsp;This type affects females during pregnancy. Some women have very high levels of glucose in their blood, and their bodies are unable to produce enough insulin to transport all of the glucose into their cells, resulting in progressively rising levels of glucose.</p>
<p>The majority of gestational diabetes patients can control their diabetes with exercise and diet. 10% - 20% of them will need to take some kind of blood-glucose-controlling medications.</p>

<p>Undiagnosed or uncontrolled gestational diabetes can raise the risk of complications during childbirth. The baby maybe bigger than he/she should be.</p>

<h4>RISK FACTORS FOR GESTATIONAL DIABETES</h4>

<p>It is found that women whose diets before becoming pregnant were high in animal fat and cholesterol has a higher risk for gestational diabetes, compared to other women whose diets were low in cholesterol and animal fats.</p>

<p>The vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes initially had prediabetes. Their blood glucose levels were higher than normal, but not high enough to merit a diabetes diagnosis. The cells in the body are becoming resistant to insulin.</p>

<p>Studies have indicated that even at the prediabetes stage, some damage to the circulatory system and the heart may already have occurred.</p>

<p><strong>Complications Linked to Badly Controlled Diabetes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eye Complications</strong>&nbsp;- Glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, etc....</li>
<li><strong>Foot Complications</strong>&nbsp;- Neuropathy, ulcers, and sometimes gangrene which may require that the foot be imputed.</li>
<li><strong>Skin Complications</strong>&nbsp;- people with diabetes are more susceptible to skin infections and skin disorders</li>
<li><strong>Heart Problems</strong>&nbsp;- Ischemic heart disease, when the blood supply to the heart muscle is diminished.</li>
<li><strong>Hypertension</strong>&nbsp;- Kidney disease, eye problems, heart attack and stroke</li>
<li><strong>Mental Health</strong>&nbsp;- Depression, anxiety, etc</li>
<li><strong>Hearing loss</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gum disease</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gastroparesis</strong></li>
<li><strong>Infections</strong></li>
<li>Cuts and wounds take much longer to heal</li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

<li>Weight loss</li>
<li>Increased urine output</li>
<li>Excessive thirst</li>
<li>Hunger</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Skin problems</li>
<li>Slow healing wounds</li>
<li>Yeast infections</li>
<li>Tingling or numbness in the feet or toes</li>
</ul>

<div id="FAid"><h3>First Aid</h3>

	<ol>

	<li>If the patient is unconscious<li>

<p>Support the patient on their side and call 111 for an ambulance.</p>

<li>If conscious, give the patient some sugar</li>

<p>If the patient is still fully conscious and able to swallow, give a sweetened drink, chocolate or glucose sweets to suck – an improvement usually occurs within minutes.</p>
<p>
When the patient is more alert, offer a more substantial carbohydrate meal of a sandwich or several sweet biscuits.</p>

<li>   If unconscious</li>
<p>

It is common for these patients to be unconscious. If so, support the patient on their side and call 111 for an ambulance. In this situation, DO NOT give the patient anything to eat or drink.</p>

<p>Give frequent reassurance during recovery because the patient may be confused until fully recovered.</p>

<li> Obtain medical advice</li>

<p>If the patient has improved with the intake of carbohydrate, medical advice is still necessary because a further deterioration may occur at any time. The patient should see a doctor.</p>

<p>If the patient does not improve after swallowing the sweet food or drink, or if further deterioration occurs and swallowing becomes difficult – call 111 for an ambulance.</p>

<p>If concious, give the patient some sugar.</p>

<p><strong>DO NOT try to give the patient a dose of insulin because this can be dangerous unless a medical assessment has been carried out and the patient’s blood sugar level tested.</strong></p>

<div id="Reme"><h3>Diabetes Tests</h3>

<ul>

<li>The A1C test</li>
<li>FPG or FBS</li>
<li>OGTT</li>
</ul>


<h4>A1C Test</h4>

<p><strong>&gt;= 6.5% Diabetes</strong></p>

<p><strong>Between 5.7% &amp; 5.99% Prediabetes</strong></p>

<p><strong>&lt;5.7% Normal</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>FPG or FBS Test</h4>

<p><strong><em>FPG -&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Fasting Plasma Glucose</em></p>
<p><strong><em>FBS -&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Fasting Blood Sugar</em></p>
<p><strong>&gt;= 126mg/dl Diabetes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Between 100md/dl &amp; 125.99 mg/dl Prediabetes</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt; 100 mg/dl Normal</strong></p>
<p>Abnormal readings means that the patient has<strong>&nbsp;Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>OGTT</h4>

<p><strong>OGTT</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>Oral Glucose Tolerance Test</em></p>
<p><strong>&gt;= 200 mg/dl Diabetes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Between 140 mg/dl &amp; 199.9 mg/dl Prediabetes</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt; 140 mg/dl Normal</strong></p>
<p>Abnormal readings means that the patient has<strong>&nbsp;Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT)</strong></p>

</div>



<div id="Prec"><h3>Controlling Diabetes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Patients with type 1 are treated with regular insulin injections, as well as a special diet ND exercise.</li>
<li>Patients with type 2 diabetes are usually treated with tablets, exercise and a special diet, but sometimes insulin injections are also required.</li>
</ul>

<p>If diabetes is not adequately controlled the patient has a significantly higher risk of developing complications.</p>
