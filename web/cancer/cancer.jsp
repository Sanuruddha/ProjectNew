            <p>
                Cancer is not just a one disease but a collection of many related diseases. Our body is made up of trillions of cells. Normally they grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow and become damaged they die and new cells take their place. It is the ordinary process. But when cancer matures, that process breaks down and cells become more and more abnormal. Old or damaged cells do not die.  They form new cells when they are not needed and divide endlessly forming growths called ‘tumors’.  </p>

                <p>  
                Most cancers form solid tumors instead of blood cancers. These tumors are malicious and they can spread into nearby tissues and also sometimes they can travel to distant places in the body through the blood and form new tumors far from the original tumor. ‘Benign tumors’ do not spread like malicious tumors, when they are removed they do not grow again but unlike other tumors elsewhere in the body ‘brain benign tumors’ can be life threating.

                <p>It is not clearly identified why one person develops cancer and other person doesn’t. But researches show the factors which increase the risk of cancer. </p>

                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age</li>
                    <p>
                According to the most recent statistical data the median age of a cancer diagnosis is 66. It means that half of cancer victims are below this age and half of victims are above this. So the ‘age’ has become the most important risk factor for cancer overall. But keep in mind that the disease can occur at any age.
                            </p>

                    <li>Alcohol</li>
                    <p>
                Drinking alcohol can increase the risk of cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, larynx (voice box), liver, and breast. The more you drink, the higher your risk. The risk is much higher for those who drink alcohol and use tobacco. </p>
                <p>
                It has been suggested that certain substances in red wine has anticancer properties. But it is not said that drinking red wine reduces the risk of cancer.
                </p>

            <li>Cancer causing substances in the environment</li>
            <p>
                People can avoid some cancer-causing exposures, such as tobacco smoke and the sun’s rays. But there are some factors that are harder to avoid, especially when they are in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, or the materials we use to do our jobs. Scientists are studying which exposures may cause or contribute to the development of cancer. So it is useful for the people as they could understand and avoid those factors. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Aflatoxins, Aristolochic Acids, Arsenic, Asbestos, Benzene, Cadmium, Wood Dust, and Mineral Oils are some of them.
                </p>

            <li> Radiation</li>
            <p>
                Certain wave length radiation that is called ‘ionizing radiation’, damages DNA and cause cancer. These radiations include radon, x-rays, gamma rays, and other forms of high-energy radiation.
                </p>
                <p>
                ‘Non ionizing radiation’ that are lower energized forms do not damage DNA. Such as visible light and the energy from cell phones and electromagnetic fields.
                </p>

                <li>Sunlight</li>
                <p>
                Earth has a shield called Ozone and it is the protector who protects us from ultraviolent radiations of sunrays. But as a result of bad human habits of polluting the environment the shield is damaged now and UV rays come down. So we must limit the amount of time we spend in the sun as these UV rays can cause to skin cancers. It is important to keep in mind that UV radiation is reflected by sand, water, snow, and ice and can go through windshields and windows.</p>

                <p>
                Protective clothing is the best way to lessen UV damage (wear long sleeves, long pants, a hat with a wide brim, and sunglasses with lenses that absorb UV radiation)
                </p>

                <li>Chronic Inflammation</li>

                <li>Diet</li>
                 <li>Hormones </li>
                 <li>Immunosuppression</li>
                 <li>Infectious Agents</li>
                 <li>Obesity</li>
                 <li>Tobacco </li>

        <div id="Symp"><h3>Symptoms</h3>

        

        <p>

            There are many different symptoms that a cancer can cause but they may also be caused by other problems. If the symptoms last for a couple of weeks, it is very important to see a doctor to get diagnosed and treated. Sometimes we do not get things so serious until we feel the pain, but it is very important to know that ‘early cancer does not cause pain’. So if you have the below symptoms, do not wait to see a doctor until you feel the pain.
            </p>

            <p>

            You will get a thickening skin and a cough that does not go away, painful urination, problems with eating such as changes in appetite, discomfort after eating and swallowing difficulties. Also weight gaining or weight loss without knowing the reasons, abdominal pain, and night sweats, unusual bleeding, blood in the urine, vaginal bleeding and feeling week or very tired. 
            </p>

            <p>

            Instead of these symptoms, breast cancers will get the changes like change in size or shape of the breast or nipple and change in texture of breast skin.
            </p>

        <div id="FAid"><h3>First Aid</h3>

        <br>

            
            <p>When someone is being treated for cancer, really there is no first aid to render.  </p>

            <p>Instead we can supply “Emotional first aid”. The best thing that we must give them is our emotional care, patience and understanding. Cancer patients may exhibit many feelings like anger, fear, stress, depression, loneliness and sadness.</p>
            <p>  So it is very important to understand the patients’ feelings and treat them with kindness and understanding. Loss of appetite is also a symptom that can be commonly seen among cancer patients. So it’s better if we can serve them with foods look appealing and hopefully the patient will be able to eat.</p>

                </div>

        <div id="Reme"><h3>Remedies</h3>

        <br>

            
        <p>There are many cancer treatments and the type of the treatment is based on the type of cancer and how advanced it is.
        The main types of cancer treatment include:
        </p>

        <li>Surgery</li>
        <p>
        It is the procedure in which the surgeons remove the cancer from the body. Small, thin knives and sharp tools are used to cut the body and do cuts through skin, muscles and sometimes through bones. Surgery is used to remove the tumor, debulk a tumor (part of a tumor is removed as it is dangerous to remove the whole tumor), ease cancer symptoms (remove tumors that are causing pain)
        </p>

        <li>Radiation therapy</li>
        <p>
        In radiation therapy, high doses of radiation are used to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. There are two types of radiation therapy “external beam and internal”. Radiation therapy is used either to treat the cancer or ease cancer symptoms. </p>

        <li>Chemotherapy</li>
        <p>
        In chemotherapy drugs are used to kill the cancer cells. It works by stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells which grow and divide so quickly. This is also used either to treat the cancer or ease cancer symptoms. </p>

        <li>Immunotherapy</li>
        <p>
        It is a type of a cancer treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer as it is the system in our body to fight infections and other diseases. It is made up of white blood cells, organs and tissues of the lymph system. Immunotherapy is type of biological therapy. Biological therapy is a type of treatment that uses substances made from living organism to treat cancer.</p>

        <li>Targeted therapy</li>
        <li> Hormone therapy</li>
        <li> stem cell transplant</li>
        <li> precision medicine </li>

        <p>
These are the other treatment types for cancers.</p>

        <div id="Prec"><h3>Precautions</h3>

            <br>

        <img src="cancerremediesinfo.jpg">

        <br>

           <p>If someone is concerned about cancer prevention there are some simple lifestyle facts to change. </p>

            <p>Any kind of a tobacco using puts you in trouble with cancer and it is linked with various types of cancer such as cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, larynx, bladder and kidney. Even if someone breaths the second hand smoke can also increase the risk of lung cancer. So anyone can reduce the risk of cancer mainly by quitting tobacco.</p>

            <p>Foods can also reduce the risk of cancer. By eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, eating fewer high calorie foods, limiting processed meats, using olive oil over butter and fish instead of red meat, eating more and more plant based foods can reduce the risk of cancer.</p>

            <p>Always try to keep a healthy weight and be physically active. You must include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine.<p>
