            <p>
                Dengue is a mosquito borne disease. A virus is responsible for the disease while it is transmitted by <i>Aedes aegypti</i>.  The disease breaks out rapidly in rainy season, given the fact that the carrier mosquitoes breed in pure water collections. 
                </p>

                <br>

                <br>

            <p>
                When this striped mosquito bites a Dengue-infected person, the virus enters the mosquito. After being bitten by this infected mosquito, a person could come down with Dengue fever.
                </p>

            <p>
                Since this virus is not contagious, Dengue cannot be spread directly from person to person. There are five serotypes of Dengue virus. Once a person is affected by Dengue, he/she develops immunity for that certain type of serotype. So, although the person could be affected by Dengue again, he/she would not be affected by the particular kind of serotype.
                </p>

            <p>
                Dengue is also known by the name “Break-bone fever”. This is due to the fact that, Dengue patients go through immense pains in joints and muscles.
                </p>

            <p>
                When the disease turns to a more severe status, it’s called “Dengue Hemorrhagic fever”. The symptoms become more intense in this stage. This can be life-threatening and could worsen into the stage of “Dengue Shock Syndrome” (DSS).

            </p>

            </div>

        <div id="Symp"><h3>Symptoms</h3>

        <br>

        <img src="symptoms.jpg">

        <br>

            <p>
                The symptoms of the disease is more likely to appear within the first 5-8 days of the infection. The most initial symptoms include headache and the pain in the back of the eyes that could worsen upon moving the eyes. Apart from these, pain in joints and muscles, loss of appetite and the low backache appears within the first few hours. 
                </p>

            <p>
                The body temperature rises up to 40 degree Celsius quickly. The heart rate drops a little causing low blood pressure.
                </p>

            <p>
                The slightly pink rash that that comes over the face and disappears is also another symptom. The eyes become reddened. The palms and soles may become reddened and swollen. The lymphatic nodes also becomes swollen. The skin is very easily bruised.
                </p>

            <p>
                The presence of fever, rash and headache is known as the “Dengue Triad” which is a characteristic of the Dengue disease.
                </p>

                </div>

                <br>

        <div id="FAid"><h3>First Aid</h3>

        <br>

            <p>
                If the symptoms are present in a person and you suspect it is Dengue, resting and oral rehydration should be implemented. 
                </p>

            <p>
                It is not advisable to provide aspirin and NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) without the recommendation of a doctor because it might cause in increment of the symptoms. Usage of Acetaminophen would ease the symptoms. If the person starts to feel worse in the first 24 hours after the fever goes down, a doctor should be consulted immediately.
                </p>

                </div>

                <br>

        <div id="Reme"><h3>Remedies</h3>

        <br>

            <p>
                Since Dengue is a viral disease, there is no specific treatments. If the person shows most of the symptoms, it is recommended that he/she should be moved from home treatments to the hospital.
                </p>

            <p>
                Once hospitalized, the patients may receive IV fluids to keep the body hydrated.
                </p>

            <p>
                The doctor may use a blood report to diagnose and verify the disease because consideration of symptoms alone may lead to false conclusions. There are two types of testing; Antibody Testing and Molecular Testing.
                </p>

            <p>
                Antibody testing could be positive even when the person is affected with another arbovirus. For specific treatments, the doctor may consider the medical history, test results and the travel history of the particular person.
                </p>

                <br>

                </div>

        <div id="Prec"><h3>Precautions</h3>

            <br>

        <img src="precautions-of-dengue.jpg">

        <br>

            <p>
                There are no specific vaccinations and other treatments as such to prevent Dengue infection. Therefore, preventing the bites of the infected mosquitoes is of high importance.
                </p>

            <p>
                The environment should be kept clean in order to keep the mosquito population down. The places where clean water can get collected should be removed, or else the water should be changed regularly.
                </p>

            <p>
                Usage of mosquito repellents, usage of appropriate clothes when being outside and using mosquito nets a night would enable the prevention of infected mosquito bites.
                </p>

            <p>
                If there is a Dengue-infected person at home, be careful to keep yourself and the other family members from catching the disease.
                </p>
